				<b><u>Name:</u></b> Jason Cao <br>
				<b><u>Role:</u></b>Team Leader<br>
				<b><u>Email:</u></b> cao216@purdue.edu <br>
				<b><u>Progress Report:</u></b> <a href="Team/progress/progress1.html">Link</a><br>
				<b><u>About:</u></b>
				Jason Cao has been part of numerous different group projects, both within and outside of Purdue University, as a team member and a team leader, with multiple projects being successful.  In each of his projects, he takes the initiative in driving the project forward and assists his peers when issues arise, whether it is dealing with erroneous code or clarifying any programming objectives.  In the past, he has worked in a biotechnology company where he successfully created software scripts using a custom version of JScript to control lab machinery.  These scripts are still in use to assist researchers with their experiments.  In addition to having taken a variety of ECE courses ranging from the basics of low-level programming to complex higher level languages, he is able to actively coordinate and lead his teammates to completing project objectives, which makes him qualified as the project leader for this venture.

				<b><u>Progress Report:</u></b> <a href="Team/progress/progress2.html">Link</a><br>    
				<b><u>About:</u></b>
				Zicong Wang has had experience in low level programming with microcontrollers.  He has had research experience in developing deep learning algorithms with Professor Allebach.  During his time on the project, he modified a pre-existing deep learning program to recognize text from a printed document, and output to a file of optimized resolution that could be compressed to a smaller file size.  He has programming training in a multitude of high-level programming languages, like Python, C, and Java.  From his prior projects, he has had an abundance of experience prototyping new software, which makes him qualified as a software engineer for this project.

				<b><u>Email:</u></b> reastman@purdue.edu <br>
				<b><u>Progress Report:</u></b> <a href="Team/progress/progress4.html">Link</a><br>    
				<b><u>About:</u></b>
				Ryan Eastman has been in charge of low level coding and design in industrial settings in the past and has taken low level coding classes here at purdue. He loves the C language to an unreasonable degree and is very familiar with assembly (see ECE 468 Compilers). In the past he designed a well controller system currently in use at Calportland Cement. These experiences qualify him to be the system engineer for this project.
