This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Jason Cao</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1/28/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Assigned roles and responsibilites to team members based on technical knowledge base, background, and interests.  
			Further revised Initial Proposal document according the instructor's feedback.  Contributed to the Final Proposal document by writing Project Description, parts of Roles and Responsibilities, and Homework Assignment Responsibilities.  Contributed to Project Specific Success Criteria #3, #4, and #5 through productive conversations with teammates.  Performed preliminary research on 2D barcode scanners to gauge the price range. </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1/28/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Further revised Final Proposal document based on instructor feedback.  Helped generate more specific Project Specific Success Criteria through productive team meetings using previously suggestions discussed with teacher assistant and instructors.  Corrected the budget in Final Proposal document.  Performed more research into 2D barcode scanners using viable vendors that do not have delays.  Started initial planning and setting up personal computer for software implementation of microcontroller.</br>
             
	    <br>
	
            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2/05/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Further looked into implementation of physical hardware.  Looked at multiple different variations of conveyor belt rollers, included sprocketed rollers and grooved rollers. Finalized the choice of conveyor belt material with Jonah based on specifications of coefficient of friction.  
	    Also discussed with Ryan about how to implement the array of barcode sensors with the microcontroller.  Talked about different communication protocols, such as I2C, serial, and USART.  Found that USART was the most preferrable protocol to use.  Beginning to form preliminary allocation of microcontroller resources (GPIO, USART, etc.).
			Beginning to compile list of finalized parts to purchase.</br>

	    <h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2/12/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Completed preliminary design of hardware assembly of conveyor belt system.  Looked into purchasing of frame structure to hold conveyor components.  Order already placed for barcode sensor.  Began ordering essential components (motors, sensors, etc.). More physical components (i.e. structural components) will be ordered by the end of Week 5.  Completed preliminary list of parts to purchase.  This list contains all of the parts that 
			are necessary for project completion, not taking into account any issues that may arise during assembly.</br>

		<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2/19/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Completed order for essential electronic parts (i.e. sensors, voltage regulators, etc.).  A major cost barrier has arisen due to the structural components solely from McMaster-Carr.  More alternative options are being discussed as to reduce costs, while still maintaining the quality of the project.
	Barcode sensor order has not come yet, and will hopefully be addressed as soon as possible.  Ordering for structural components will be put on hold as alternatives are being discussed, like local supplier Fastenol.  
	By end of week 6, all structural components should be ordered.  The Bill of Materials will primarily be used as a checklist to track which components have been ordered.</br>
