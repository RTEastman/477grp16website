            <h2>Progress Report for Zicong Wang</h2>
            
            <h4>Week 1:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> Jan.28.2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Collaborated with team to work on Final Proposal by contributing on personal
			role section. Decided to take on software engineer role. 
			Viewed video Lectures and completed participation quizzes. </br>

            <br>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1/28/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
            Worked with team to review the Final Proposal for resubmission. Re-estimated
			budget and corrected Homework assignment responsibilities. Revised PSSC
			by adding multiple components that our microcontroller interface with, such as
			motor driver, barcode scanner, etc. Viewed lecture 
			videos and completed participation quizzes</br>
                      
			<br>
			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/4/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			1. Clarified on prototype design, raised a new sorting functionality by adding another angel to each servo-controlled flaps, allowing for three more sorting destinations. This solution is 
				viable but adds unnecessary challenges to overcome, and thus will only be considered after minimal prototype is done.</br>
			<br>2. Researched on working of barcode scanner, modulo check character formula, barcode types,etc, and wrote overview of how the barcode scanner interacts with the MCU. </br>
			<br>3. Collaborated with team to finalize electrical component choices such as motors and conveyor belts in future purchases.</br>

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/11/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			1. Researched on the servo motor and how servo controller and servo error amplifier unit exchange data with each other to make the servo motor rotate
				to desired positions, and how potentiometor feedback error changes the direction of the servo motor rotates.</br>
			<br>2. Collaborated with team to make additions on the list of materials. Discussed and decided to include necessary supportive components like frames and standings.  </br>

			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/19/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Met with team to discuss part specifications to ensure compatability and to provide statistics with mechanical overview. Investigate upon legal technical
			certifications that are needed to push product to market, certificates such as FCC, NTEP. Researched on United States FCC spectrum regulation to ensure
			our frequencies (e.g. 480MHz) stay out of reserved ranges for special categories of uses.

			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/25/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			After meeting with instructor earlier this week and discussing the buying options among ourselves,
			our team has decided to move on from 60% of previously determined materials 
			from the sheet of materials(mostly mechanical parts), and will be discussing the replacement of a 
			more integrated premade conveyor belt system skeleton. Mostly searched through marketplaces to 
			look for reasonably priced barebone conveyor belt or conveyor belts with a motor to extract and 
			replace with our own. That being mentioned, we still need our sprockets implemented in the system to
			achieve our goals. Mostly looked at ones below $500 as shown. The range of dimensions of acceptable 
			systems were recorded in our meeting attached below. It is worth noting that there are standards 
			concerning width of conveyor systems with closest to our expectations: 7.8 and 11.8 in.

			<h4>Week 7:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 3/5/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Continued to look for conveyor belt systems that fits with our design dimensions. VEVOR was what we found
			to be most cost-efficient whole-system conveyor belt product that we can integrate into our prototype. 
			I contacted the representative of VEVOR to discuss a possiblity of a discount due to the unecessity of 
			built-in motor to our project in favor of their advertisement. The deal did not go through and we are currently
			contacting EII for a free conveyor system. Worked on Midterm design review in order to prepare for review presentation 
			in week 8. Mostly focused on prototype hardware progress and timeline.
