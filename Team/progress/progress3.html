            <h2>Progress Report for Jonah Shader</h2>
			<h4>Week 1:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 1/29/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 5<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			I discussed changes that would need to happen hardware wise in order to have a functioning conveyer belt. Specifically, I informed the team that servo motors should be used for the sorting flaps instead of brushed DC motors. I also did research into the circuits needed to drive the motors.
			<br>
			<h4>Week 2:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 1/29/21<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			We redid the PSSC’s in the Final Project Proposal (FPP) to better describe how certain criteria would be accomplished. I specifically rewrote PSSC #2: “An ability to control all servo positions using level-shifted pwms of variable duty cycle originating from the mcu.” I also edited my background in the FPP to be more clear about my past experience. I also worked on the functional spec document.
            <br>
			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/5/21<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 12<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			 I spent a long time at the start of the week working out which Geared Brushed DC motor to select. We decided that the conveyor belt needed to move a maximum of 23kg at a speed of 30cm/s. After doing calculations, I found that I needed a motor that had a power output of ~69 watts, or ~0.1 hoursepower, to accomplish the task with a friction coefficient of 1. With further calculations accounting for specific speed and torque of several motors, I decided on a motor that would probably work: MakerMotor's PN01007-10038.

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/12/21<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 16<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			Torwards the start of the week, I was working on figuring out the power budget of our system with the motor I had originally selected. During wednesday's lab meeting, I was told that there were very powerful motors in stock that I could check out from the 477 supplies. To see if this motor would work with the kind of power I had in mind for this project, I did even more motor math this week, as seen in the image below. It turns out that the NPC-T74 will in fact work under our maximum constraints at roughly the same voltage and current as the PN01007. 
			Seperately, I did some research on potential solutions for making the support structure of the conveyor belt, and I informed the team that aluminum T-slot framing was the best option for what we needed. After consensus was reached, Jason and I did a lot of research to figure out what T-slot parts we would need to construct a good frame, and will continue to do so into next week.
			Another thing I did this week was figure out what sensor we should use to keep track of the position of the boxes on the conveyor belt. I decided on an IR laser ranging sensor that has a narrow cone of detection up to a range of 2 meters: the Taidacent TOF10120.

			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/19/21<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 12<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			This week, I focused a large majority of my efforts on defining the performance of our selected servo. Specifically, I wanted to optimize the angle needed to get the package off the belt as fast as possible, as well as determining the speed at which the sorting flaps can fully deploy. I made interactive tools through desmos so we can redefine variables as we need to in the future. Figure 5.1 goes over my theoretical work, while figures 5.2 and 5.3 demonstrate the interactive desmos graphs for frictional box acceleration and flap deployment, respectively. Here are the links to the desmos graphs: (figure 5.2) https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mrl0v81tjq ; (figure 5.3) https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yp7yjcj01m . I also continued working on the structural components of the system with Jason this week, specifically in attempting to bring our costs down. I discovered Fastenal: a local industrial supply company that sells 80/20 aluminum at a potentiially lower cost compared to McMaster.
