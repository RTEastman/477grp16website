			<h2>Progress Report for Ryan Eastman</h2>
			
			<h4>Week 1:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> Jan.28.2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 9<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I worked on organizing the group. I helped make the list of materials we'll need to build and designed the buget. I worked on finishing the preposal and assigning roles. 
			I began designing a template for the website. </br>

			<br>

			<h4>Week 2:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 1/28/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I worked with the team to help choose our components and make decisions on what we need to make everything run. In addition I spent a large amount of time relearning 
			html in order to work on the website. In addition I did a very large amount of the coding and designing of the website and troubleshooting to make sure everything is functioning as done.</br>
			
			<br>
	
			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/05/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week we focused on component analysis. I spent time pouring through the data sheets of four different microcontrollers and read at least f manuals for barcode readers 
			to try and determine if they are suitable for our use. In addition I did the math to calculate the area the camera will read and how man frames per second we need to gurantee 
			that we can capture an image of the barcode as it's going past at rapid speeds. </br>

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/12/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			At the beginning of the week I worked to set up our IDE and refamiliarize myself with the documentation for the microcontroller we decided to use (STM32F0Disvovery).
			Then as the week went on we met multiple times to discuss our componenet purchases and make some final decisions on what would work and what would not work. 
			And of course I wrote a quick program for the microcontroller to blink the light and change the speed at which it blinked.</br>

			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/19/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 13<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I completed the mechanical overview. This involved about 9 hours of relearning cad then modeling all our specific parts. Then it involved remodeling parts
			to correct from some errors that occured when converting in to cm. In addition we met and discussed for hours about potential issues such as servos 
			not being strong enough to move boxes and issues that may pertain to the friction of the material we use for our arms that swing out. </br>

			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/26/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 12<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week we met a few times to discuss part selections. We mostly talked about finalizing the conveyor belt purchase and decision. We talked about what methods of
			communication we think will actually work best. In additrion I worked on getting our distance sensor to communicate with our STM32 using I2C. This
			was especially difficult as our sensor (TOF10120) does not have a readily availible english datasheet to use. With the help of my team we were
			able to find a translated (Chinese to English) version of the datasheet. We did get it to start reading distances thanks to the datasheet however getting it to do it
			continiously has not yet worked. </br>

			<h4>Week 7:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/26/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week we met several times to discussour timeline, our design review, and finilize our decisions for what system and pines we'll be using 
			on our mcu. IN addition I began work updating our 3d model with more accurate and detailed packaging anf updated heights.</br>

			<h4>Week 8:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 2/26/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week I went with the team to Engineering innovation where we dissasembled and loaded a conveyor belt into my car. We then moved all the stuff into my apartment.
			later I helped build the conveyor belt in my storage room. In addition I revised the I2C code I wrote for the distance sensor to iron out a few bugs with onconsistant distance values.

			<h4>Week 10:</h4>
			<b>Date:</b> 3/26/2021<br>
			<b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week we all met and got the conveyor belt to run for the first time. Individually I began writing the timer and intturupts we'll use for our 
			distance sensor to function properly.
